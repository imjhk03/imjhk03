I'm an iOS developer based in South Korea. Currently Iâ€™m working full-time for Brandi Co., which provides a platform for stores to sell their products to users from our app. Because of the former senior developer had to go on parental vacation, I've been temporarily the head of iOS Engineer, leading the iOS team from June 2019 to May 2020.

Creating something good for people and crafting for better experience is my goal. Learning new things always make me want to code more. Prefers seafood to meat and coke is my fuel.
